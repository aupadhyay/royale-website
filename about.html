				<center><h1>Our Purpose</h1></center>
				<div><p><b>Defying stereotypes. Breaking trends. Being unique. </b> Royale stands for a lot more than just a clothing brand. It is the mere notion that anyone can do the unexpected. Following the crowd and conforming to everyone’s expectations is the easy route to take, but in the end, doing what you truly want speaks volumes more to the mind.</p></div>

					<div class="col-md-8" style="padding-left:50px;display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle;"><p>Venkat Uppalapati and Abhinay Aeruva, the founders of Royale Apparel, are currently juniors at Mission San Jose High School. Royale was founded on the principle that stylish clothing could be targeted towards everyone, not just the designated “hype” target market. Clothing in that market, often unreasonably expensive, is not readily made available to the general audience. Royale Apparel seeks to change that, as our youthful and unique clothing is priced much more reasonably, yet has innovative and standout designs. </p></div>

					<div class="col-md-8" style="padding-left:50px;"><p>Our logo is simple, but it defines who we are and what we stand for. The lion represents strength, and courage. We are raising money to help little boys and girls win the war against cancer. Each and every one of them are extremely strong and courageous for continuing to fight against the cold clutches of cancer. The crown represents authority, command and power. By being courageous and strong, these little soldiers have taken command of their lives and they lead the fight against cancer.
